**My Life**: ü¶ê Eat üí™ Exercise ü§ñ Code üéß Music üçø Movies üò¥ Sleep

## My cinema taste:

I'm drawn towards **_realistic_** films that are **_visually stunning_**, **_emotionally charged_**, and **_mind-blowing_** in their storytelling. I love the depiction of **_loneliness_** in cinema, the beauty of **_romance_** and **_eroticism_**, and **_narratives_** that challenge how I see the world.

#### If you ask me what is cinema?

I say its a **_getaway car_** to escape from reality.

**Note:** My ratings and reviews are heavily influenced by my **mood**. A masterpiece might get a lower rating if I‚Äôm in a funk, while a mediocre flick could receive higher praise if it resonates with me emotionally at the right time.
