**My Life**: 🦐 Devour 💪 Pump Iron 🤖 Code Wizard 🎧 Vibe Out 🍿 Film Junkie 🥵 Spicy Content 😴 Recharge

I'm **_progressive as hell_** 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💗☮️♀️♿✊🏾🎗️⚛️, so naturally, I dive headfirst into debates, especially when the other side's stuck in the past.

**Current Goal**: Death ☠️ and exploring what comes next?

## Cinema Taste:

I'm drawn to films that are **_visually mesmerizing_**, **_emotionally electrifying_**, and **_mind-bending_** in their storytelling. The art of **_loneliness_** on screen, the allure of **_romance_** and **_eroticism_**, and **_stories_** that flip my worldview upside down, that's my kind of escape.

Basically, cinema is my getaway car from reality.

## Quotes that describe me:

**"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept."** — _Angela Davis: Portrait of a Revolutionary_ (1984)

**"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion."** — _Thelma & Louise_ (1991)

**"I would rather be a free soul in a cage than a caged soul in a free world."** — _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001)

**Note:** My ratings are a wild ride, highs and lows based on how the film vibes with my mood. A masterpiece might get snubbed if I’m in a funk, while a mediocre flick could soar if it hits me in the feels at just the right time.
