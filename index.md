**My Life**: ü¶ê Eat üí™ Exercise ü§ñ Code üéß Music üçø Movies üò¥ Sleep

I'm mostly awake at night and happiest when it rains. Addicted to music and movies, always chasing that perfect mood. Not into social media, but I love anything that‚Äôs open, free, and progressive.

## My taste in films:

I'm drawn towards **_realistic_** films that are **_visually stunning_**, **_emotionally charged_**, and **_mind-blowing_** in their storytelling. I love the depiction of **_loneliness_** in cinema, the beauty of **_romance_** and **_eroticism_**, and **_narratives_** that challenge how I see the world.

**Note to viewers:**

My ratings and reviews are heavily influenced by my **mood**. A masterpiece might get a lower rating if I‚Äôm in a funk, while a mediocre flick could receive higher praise if it resonates with me emotionally at the right time.
